 * Resolves the macOS `.app` bundle directory name (without the `.app` suffix).

 * The same value must be used by every macOS packaging backend. electron-builder stages the bundle
 * inside a DMG under `${productFilename}.app` while its ZIP target archives the prepackaged
 * directory as-is, so the two artifacts only agree when the prepackaged directory is already named
 * `${productFilename}.app`. Feeding this single resolution into jpackage's output, the GraalVM
 * bundle and electron-builder's `productName` keeps that invariant true by construction — an app
 * installed from the DMG can then be updated from the ZIP and vice versa.
 *
 * The result is normalized to NFD because a DMG carries an HFS+ volume, and HFS+ decomposes every
 * file name it stores. Naming the bundle in NFD up front is what makes the DMG entry and the ZIP
 * entry — which preserves whatever the build produced — byte-identical rather than merely equivalent.
 *
 * Precedence: explicit `macOS.bundleName` > `appName` > `macOS.packageName` / `packageName` >
 * [fallback] (normally the Gradle project name).
